# PubSub Example

This is just an example of how you may use `chip` as a PubSub system for your app. 

There are many approaches, so if you're starting out I would recommend to keep things basic as in the [pubsub](../pubsub/) examples.

This example serves the purpose of how we could divide each part of the system in discrete modules: client, pubsub, server, etc. 

For more context follow the guide [chip as a local pubsub](../../../guides/chip-as-a-local-pubsub.md).
